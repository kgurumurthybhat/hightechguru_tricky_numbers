Customer Obsession.
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
Always one of the favorites to include in interview loops. I suspect as a principle it strikes so many candidates as obvious that they don’t realize what we’re really getting at. Every decision of consequence at Amazon involves the customer. Not just how they’ll react, but what is actually best for them.
What factors would you consider when deciding which oJer should win the buy-box on the retail website?
“Maximize proHt”
What else would you consider?
“Volume of sales, conversion rate, margin, etc, but it all comes back to proHt.”
When interviewing research scientists for example (per the above), I’ve had some repeatedly insist that the right thing to do is to use algorithms to maximize proHt. Even when I give a hint such as “What unintended consequence might happen if you only optimized for proEt?”, they often miss the customer experience ramiHcations.
The thing we’re looking for is that you consider and care about the customer. We’ve regularly made decisions at Amazon which lowered proHt/sales, because it was the
 
right thing to do for customers. We all understand that the company performs better if our customers (and our employees) believe it’s acting in our best interest. We believe that’s the right thing to do, we make those decisions all the time, and we reward people for it. We need to make sure new hires will do the same thing.
For that feature, who was the customer?
“The product management team gave us requirements.”
But who was the end customer?
“Well, the marketing team I suppose, because they wanted marketing slots. Oh! And the sales group too.”
But who was the customer?
“I don’t understand”
It’s somewhat shocking how often people buried in large companies don’t mentally identify their customer as the Hnal external customer. Their customer is their boss, sales, marketing, etc. They are so focused on doing what they’re told, so focused on building what they’re asked, without taking a big step back to understand who uses their product.
“I wrote the contact-us form for customer questions, but then I was watching the questions coming in (out of curiosity), and I saw so many of the questions had easy answers. I added a simple FAQ at the top of the contact form — after asking the product lead if she minded. It reduced usage of my form by a lot, which I’d call a win.”
We don’t need you to exhibit our leadership principles at your current job (we understand that other companies are di^erent), but we do expect you to be able to demonstrate customer obsession in your answers. Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your speciHc tasks), and think about solving their needs, not just tasks.

      Ownership.
      Leaders are owners.They think long term and don’t
      sacriEce
      long - term
      value
      for short - term results.They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.They never say “that’s not my job”.
      This is perhaps my favorite principle, because I think it is so core to how Amazon operates internally.You can be conHdent that you’ll be asked questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner.This leadership principle is core to deHning how our groups and company is organized.Slight digression to help you understand our model.
      At Amazon, almost every organization / team / person can identify with something(s) they own.For example, I currently own the technology for Amazon FreeTime.By deHnition, that means all technology decisions related to the product end up in my court.As an owner, that means that I am responsible when something goes wrong, responsible when decisions are made, and I act in all ways as an “owner” of the product.
      One of the managers in my group is the technology owner of the Amazon FreeTime Android application.This is still within my group, but he’s expected to act as an owner, be responsible when things go right / wrong, and so on.You’ll notice there are now two owners of the application.Of course I fully expect the engineers on the team to feel the same way.
      And Hnally, if someone from AWS S3 comes to me and says they found a problem in my Android product, I’m going to be thrilled that they care enough.I’ll invite them to my o`ce, see what they found, and discuss how we might Hx it.Because we’re all owners and we all care, no one should ever say “That’s not my job”.
      I’ve pushed for better HR policies.I’ve spent hours chasing down the owner for some random feature on the website to ask them to Hx something.I fully expect everyone I work with ( and hire) should demonstrate the same attitude.
      When that happened and your whole application went down for a day, how’d you get it back up in the end?
      
      “Well, we have an ops team which runs the website, so they eventually Hgured it out.” Did your developers help them Egure out what had broken?
      “No..that’s not our job.”
      I’d like to mention again, we don’t expect your company to use the leadership principles.We don’t expect you to have acted the way we’d expect someone at Amazon to act.However, lets take a step back.You’re in an interview, and you know we care that people act like owners.What would you do as an owner in that case? Regardless of how you want to handle it in the interview, you need to make it clear to us that you know what the Amazonian thing to do would be.
      “I was their QA and they shouldn’t trust me too far with the code because I barely know what I’m doing * laugh * but when they had a few bad weeks and were getting behind on the bug queues, I felt I had to help.I started spending a few hours a day Hxing bugs instead of testing.They were pretty simple bugs, but I felt it was a better use of my time, rather than Hnding bugs no one had time to Hx.I just did my best to document things really carefully to make sure my help was a net beneHt.”
      I remember once someone suggesting that we shouldn’t write to candidates explaining our leadership principles, because they’d be able to prepare and fool us.My response was that an interview candidate who understood what we were looking for so much that they were able to trick us, was exactly the type of candidate we’d love to have at Amazon.

      Invent and Simplify.
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always End ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
Amazon is all about innovation. We are regularly doing things people have never done before. New scale, new products, new platforms. One of the most frustrating responses
 
 from anyone who has an open question is “I can’t think of another solution”, because there is always another solution. It’s just possible we’ll need to invent one.
The other half of this principle is the idea of simpliHcation. The KISS principle is enshrined in our principles, because we all Hrmly believe that the simplest solution is the one you can maintain, the one you can iterate on, the cheapest one to build, and so on.
Minimal viable/lovable product is a concept Hrmly entrenched in how we do things, because so much about our ability to innovate, pivot, change our mind, build new things, is about doing things as simply as possible.
Ah, so you use wishlists. If you were in charge, how would you improve the wishlists feature on Amazon?
“Oh, I’d Hx the drop down to sort the lists in most recently used order.” Ok good, what else?
<Long pause> “Hm.. no, that’s about it.”
We can never be done with possible answers. We all have the capacity for in4nite ideas. We need people with a capacity for inHnite ideas, because frequently the Hrst 7 ideas we had won’t work, and we’re going to need an 8th. We need people with the capability to look at other teams in Amazon who had similar problems, solutions in the industry, solutions used in other industries, books on the topic, etc. We need the question of “What else?” to be met by such a long stream of answers that it would take us forever to try them all.
When you realized the project review meeting wasn’t useful, how did you Ex it?
“I canceled the whole thing. I realized the status we covered was already in our ticketing system, and I’d rather everyone spend that hour working. When in doubt, I always remove processes rather than Hx them.”
   
Experienced software engineers know that the best engineers often remove code when solving problems rather than adding code. Removal is always a better option, when it comes to code, systems, and processes. Simplicity allows for faster and cheaper innovation, and that’s why they’re married together in this principle.
""",
      """
      Are Right, A Lot.
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconErm their beliefs.
It’s certainly not about being faultless. I’ve heard people quip that being good at this principle is the di^erence between being right 55% of the time instead of 50%. While we’re obviously listening for someone to be intelligent while we interview them, that’s not the core of this principle.
We give our leaders (in other words, everyone) a scary/amazing amount of authority to independently get things done. “Get forgiveness instead of permission” is a popular quote, because we need people to just move. In return, we need them to both have good judgment/instincts, as well as question their own decisions and be open to counter opinions.
When she disagreed with your design, how did you know yours was right? “She was very junior, she didn’t have as much experience.”
Sure, but how did you know she was wrong?
“My instincts are really good.”
We like people with good instincts. But we absolutely require and love people to be open to being wrong. Right and wrong are a matter of knowing what you are trying to accomplish, what the options are, and how to compare the merit of the options. Right and wrong are never a matter of who is more senior or who talks the loudest. We need our leaders to recognize that every perspective and opinion needs to be valued. And someone disagreeing with you is wonderful. It gives you a chance to reexamine your
  
viewpoint.
""",
      """
      Learn and Be Curious.
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Amazon has grown in incredible ways. What used to be considered a high volume service is now a laughably small one. The large organizations of years ago are literally 20x the size they used to be, or more. From those who have been at Amazon longer, you’ll hear quotes like “When I was Erst hired, this group was at 40 people! Now it’s at 700!”
“So for the team considering me, what language is that service written in?” I believe it’s Java.
“Well I only know C++, is there a C++ team I could work for?”
We’ve all decided that what worked yesterday is not going to work today. Your code will need to be replaced, the design will change, the customers will demand more. Our services written before in Perl moved to C, and many of our C services moved to Java, and our Java services will continue to be re-written in whatever works best next. Everything changes, and so we need to as well. We place a large emphasis on everyone being open to learning new things, inventing new things, opening new doors, and being interested and inquisitive.
Tell me something interesting you’ve learned recently.
“Rust! Have you ever programmed in Rust before? It’s so interesting. So here’s the di^erences between Rust and ..”
We don’t need you to be obsessed with the latest language or newest tools or the hot new technologies in your Held. We certainly don’t need you to know the language we’re programming in today. What we do need is for you to be open and interested in
  
learning new things. Our leaders need to be open to new things, because that’s always the path forward.

      Hire and Develop the Best.
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
As a bar raiser, I’m heavily involved in this leadership principle. Hiring people who are interested in growing, and then helping them learn is a huge aspect to the leadership job. Managers hire for their teams, individual contributors interview people, and everyone is responsible for making certain we’re letting in the right folks. That’s the whole point of this article right? Making sure the right folks have the necessary information to get in :)
Each aspect of this principle is critical. For example, can you recognize strong performers?
How do you manage your top performers diJerently?
“I don’t. I think everyone deserves equal treatment. I think everyone is great in their own way.”
It’s a lovely sentiment, but it’s something we don’t believe as a high performance management culture. We believe that the top performers need our attention and guidance to ensure that they have the opportunity to provide their very best at Amazon. Spending time on our top performers is the best use of a leaders time. We do recognize exceptional talent, and believe it’s critical that our exceptional talent receives the attention they need.
So since she was so successful, what’d you have her work on next?
“Honestly, I sent her to another group. They needed a new project lead, and she was
    
 awesome, so I o^ered her to them. As great as it was to have her on the team, this was much better for her.”
Internal transferring at Amazon is an amazing and open process. We freely move around the company, and are able to self select our next job when we feel we need the growth. The very best leaders encourage others to always be stretched. If you’re comfortable, you’re not growing. Because doing things which challenge and scare you is the best way to learn. And so in the interview process, ensuring the growth of those who work with/for you is a critical talent we listen for.
It sounds like you’re more senior than all your co-workers. When they made all those mistakes, how did you help them?
“I was available if they had questions. If they didn’t want to ask for help, it’s their own fault.”
We believe it’s the responsibility of every single person to help others grow. When our college hire software development engineers join, they may spend an awkward Hrst few months Hguring out how things work. However, 3 months later, that engineer is often the one who helps ramp up the next hire. Because they are the ones with the most fresh memory of the process (and pain) of joining and Hguring things out. I love that we give the uncomfortable and new job of teaching to everyone immediately, because it’s a critical skill that everyone needs to learn.

      Insist on the Highest Standards.
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are Exed so they stay Exed.
This principle is tied heavily to the ownership principle. If you’re an owner, do you want things to be low quality? If you’re an owner, would you be embarrassed or proud of the quality you’re delivering? In the same way, we expect our leaders to be proud owners of
 
the things they own, and as such, insist on standards which everyone (including themselves) should struggle to meet.
It certainly doesn’t mean we expect long hours, and “driving” doesn’t mean beating people up. What it means is that we should never be satisHed with what we have. Look at the industries and companies which stopped innovating. You innovate when you know you’re not done, and we insist that everyone has such high standards that we’re never done.
How did you know what you had delivered was what the customer wanted?
“The product team accepted the feature, which meant we delivered their requirements.”
But was it the right features? Was it the quality you wanted?
“Well, it was good enough to be accepted, that was our goal.”
Our goal is never to deliver to requirements — to only meet our goals. At all times — once you look past our o`cial project goals — our goal is to improve. Our goal is to never accept that something is broken, to never feel that anything less than a perfect product is acceptable.
Then how did you Ex the overcharging bug?
“We didn’t. It’s annoying I guess, but no one noticed, and we make more money. It’s a feature not a bug right?! Hah!”
(I know some quotes are a bit over the top, but so are some answers in interviews.)
We care about Hxing the root causes of problems (not just hiding or patching them). We care that you are always thinking “I know we can do better than this”.
""",
      """
      Think Big.
Thinking small is a self-fulElling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold
  
 direction that inspires results. They think diJerently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
Imagine the Hrst person at Amazon who said “You know, I bet we could make a store where everything is checked out automatically by just picking up an item.” I love that thinking big is such a part of the Amazon DNA that we have it written in our leadership principles.
If you owned marketing for our kids tablets, what new things would you look into? “Well, I’d look at our creatives and A/B test which images work best.”
Sure, but what other ways do you think you could market our product?
“Buy Facebook ads? They’re very e^ective.”
Anything else?
“No, that would probably work.”
Leaders here never accept that our vision is big enough, innovative enough, or that we have high enough standards. If we are asking you in an interview for an idea, you can’t say the Hrst small idea which pops in your head, and believe you’ve satisHed the requirement. When you’re asked for ideas, you should err on the side of being asked to stop. We’re always looking for bold vision (perhaps grounded in a small amount of reality), and need to know that our leaders are open to the idea of thinking bigger than the thing in front of their face.
What other ideas do you have to improve the product detail pages on Amazon’s retail website?
“Ok, going a bit more experimental, what if we eliminated detail pages? You could just input your requirements to Amazon somehow — like you want a TV by Tuesday that’s at least 60” with some certain resolution and a certain maximum price, and then Amazon would pick it out for you and just ship it. Maybe we can eliminate customers
    
 picking out items completely.”
When I’m interviewing someone, I prefer to think that someone’s idea is somewhat impossible, because explaining constraints to a co-worker is easier than explaining how to invent and think.
""",
      """
      Bias for Action.
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
We strongly feel that making some decision is much better than making no decision. We assume that we hire smart people who are right a lot. We want those smart leaders to make quick decisions and move forward. You learn more from doing things and measuring rather than surveying or testing or projecting results.
Since the site was down and you thought it was the cache, did you try clearing it?
“Well, I guess I could have, but I didn’t want to risk being blamed for breaking something. It was much safer to wait for my manager to make the decision, it was above my pay grade.”
I know at your company it’s possible that you’re encouraged to not take action unless asked, but we Hnd that unacceptable. You should know what we’re looking for and expecting. We want leaders who take action, are bold, are willing to take risks, because they know it’s the right thing to do.
For software engineers, it’s a bit of a running joke about how many months it takes someone to completely break the service/system their team owns. Because it’s a part of being handed dangerous tools and responsibilities. For almost every major human- caused accident at Amazon, there’s a sheepish person who raises their hand and says “Yeah.. that was me”. And they’re still here, because we value calculated risk taking.
  How did you decide between the two technologies?
 “The other engineer and I discussed it for a couple hours, Hgured out what we disagreed on, and I suggested that neither answer was necessarily better. She agreed. I said that unless she had any new info, I’d rather we just pick mine, and we could always come back to the decision later if we learned something new.”
We value this type of risk taking, because we need to move fast in areas where we can’t possibly know the right answer. Option A or Option B? Pick and move on.

      """
      Frugality.
      Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-su_ciency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or Exed expense.
      This leadership principle is perhaps the most joked about within Amazon. There’s always a risk that frugality (taken to its extreme) ends up feeling a bit “frupid”. However, once you get past the fun of joking about the principle, it’s also a core element of how Amazon has managed to be successful.
      Look at the nature of how Amazon does business. AWS constantly drops prices to ensure it’s competitive (and almost always cheaper) than doing things on your own. Amazon devices (such as our tablets) are shockingly cheap compared to the value they provide. Amazon retail is well known for valuing low prices and pursues e`ciency aggressively. This principle is all about ensuring that we can provide as much value for as little cost as possible.
      Why did you get into an argument with him?
      “Because he didn’t give us enough people for the project. I told him it needed 5 people, and he said he’d give me 2. I said things cost what they cost, and if he won’t pay, we won’t do the work.”
      Things never cost what they cost, because we can always do less, do it cheaper, do it slower, do it with lower quality. We always have options. We almost never have the resources we feel we “need” at Amazon. And that does amazing things for the products we build. I know the process can frustrate people, but pay attention to the language in
        
      the principle. We’re inventing to solve problems in a cheaper way. Which often is faster, easier to maintain, easier to extend, etc.
      Then how did you Ex the lead generation tool?
      “Actually we really didn’t have the time to maintain it or rebuild it, but they really needed a tool to track their work. I realized that our bug tracking system had most of the features they needed. Certainly wasn’t perfect, but I explained how they could use it, and it worked out Hne. One less system to maintain.”
      When you’re interviewing, we’re looking for you to understand that having not enough time or resources is a Hne and expected thing. Having too much to do, and too little time is perfectly ok. Not doing everything you want on a project is healthy, because doing everything you ever wanted to do is ine`cient. The last thing on your stack rank will never be done, and we should all be happy with that.

      Earn Trust.
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
The most commonly missed aspect of this principle is the “vocally self-critical” aspect. Probably because when you’re interviewing and telling us how awesome you are, you might feel challenged to explain that you’re not awesome all the time. However, with big power comes big responsibility. It’s very important for a leader to be able to recognize when they’ve made a mistake, so that they can correct it quickly. This “earns trust” with co-workers, as well as ensures that future mistakes can be corrected quickly.
Tell me about a time you made a serious mistake at work.
“Hmm.. I can’t think of anything.”
What’s great about that quote is that I’ve heard it dozens of times. However, it might not
  
be as instructional as I need.
Tell me how that project you were leading failed.
“Well, the product manager had given us the wrong requirements, and then one of my engineers screwed up the metrics gathering. Then when we launched, marketing didn’t notice it was under-performing, and kept advertising the broken product.”
We expect leaders to always recognize that they have the power to improve things. It was someone else’s decision? Then you failed to in`uence them. It was someone else’s error? You failed to notice the mistake fast enough. When you’re explaining a mistake, Hrst recognize your own, before explaining other misses.
How did the marketing team send the emails to the wrong people?
“Well, Hrst we didn’t give them the necessary tools, so they were forced to rely on manual mail merges. It wasn’t fair to expect them to avoid errors. My team should have warned them about the risks, and we could have built better tools.. in fact, we’re in the process of building them now.”
The best leaders look dispassionately at the details of a situation and address it as a leader at Amazon. It’s not about pointing blame, it’s about Hxing processes. Mechanisms for the long term rather than being focused on the short term incident.
As an interviewer, think carefully about how you deal with mistakes, both yours and others. We care about long term, not short. We care about Hxing problems, not blaming. We care about honesty, not a story. We care about respecting those we work with, because we’re going to work together for a long time. Partially because we’re so decentralized, it’s critical that we trust those who we work with, because each of us have a lot of power and responsibility.

      Dive Deep.
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote diJer. No task is beneath them.
  
“Trust yet verify” is a favorite phrase at Amazon. We care deeply that leaders keep a careful eye on what they own, and know ways to audit their space. If something doesn’t make sense, our leaders need to have the ability (and interest) to dive in and Hgure out what’s going on.
Your team reduced latency on the website? How?
“We removed bottlenecks.”
What bottlenecks?
“Code ones.. I’m not really sure, it was one of the engineers on my team.”
I’m not suggesting that you claim knowledge over every detail of what you or your teams have worked on, but I will say that you shouldn’t tell a story where you don’t know the most obvious of details. If you increased tra`c, you better know what you did. If you dropped error rates, you should know what the errors were. We care that people know details, because it means they cared enough to question things. We need curious and skeptical leaders.
How did you reduce the memory footprint?
“It’s funny, we had to restart our system every few months because of a memory leak. I’d just joined the team, and the mystery annoyed me. So I spent a few hours reading very carefully through our memory management code, and realized that we incorrectly double-parsing in one of our helper functions. Not only did it save on memory, but CPU as well. It’d been there for years.”
I love when I ask questions of people, and they can go 4 or 5 levels deep, and keep getting more excited because the details are actually interesting to them.
